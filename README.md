This project helped me to learn the key concepts of CRUD operations to build an en·ter·prise applications in MongoDB.

Learnt the concepts of api creation using the express to deal with the MongoDB data, automate the mail services, OTP creation and verification.

For authentication we also used JWT(Json Web Tokens).

We used react to make our frontend more Responsible. 

All together I have done the MERN Stack project.

The source code of this project is uploaded in this google drive link.
